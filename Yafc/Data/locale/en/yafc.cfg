console-help-message=Usage:\nYafc [<data-path> [--mods-path <path>] [--project-file <path>] [--help]\n\nDescription:\n    Yafc can be started without any arguments. However, if arguments are supplied, it is\n    mandatory that the first argument is the path to the data directory of Factorio. The\n    other arguments are optional in any case.\n\nOptions:\n    <data-path>\n        Path of the data directory (mandatory if other arguments are supplied)\n\n    --mods-path <path>\n        Path of the mods directory (optional)\n\n    --project-file <path>\n        Path of the project file (optional)\n\n    --help\n        Display this help message and exit\n\nExamples:\n    1. Starting Yafc without any arguments:\n       $ ./Yafc\n       This opens the welcome screen.\n\n    2. Starting Yafc with a project path:\n       $ ./Yafc path/to/my/project.yafc\n       Skips the welcome screen and loads the project. If the project has not been\n       opened before, then uses the start-settings of the most-recently-opened project.\n\n    3. Starting Yafc with the path to the data directory of Factorio:\n       $ ./Yafc Factorio/data\n       This opens a fresh project and loads the game data from the supplied directory.\n       Fails if the directory does not exist.\n\n    4. Starting Yafc with the paths to the data directory and a project file:\n       $ ./Yafc Factorio/data --project-file my-project.yafc\n       This opens the supplied project and loads the game data from the supplied data\n       directory. Fails if the directory and/or the project file do not exist.\n\n    5. Starting Yafc with the paths to the data & mods directories and a project file:\n       $ ./Yafc Factorio/data --mods-path Factorio/mods --project-file my-project.yafc\n       This opens the supplied project and loads the game data and mods from the supplied\n       data and mods directories. Fails if any of the directories and/or the project file\n       do not exist.

load-error-advice=Check that these mods load in Factorio.\nYAFC only supports loading mods that were loaded in Factorio before. If you add or remove mods or change startup settings, you need to load those in Factorio and then close the game because Factorio saves mod-list.json only when exiting.\nCheck that Factorio loads mods from the same folder as YAFC.\nIf that doesn't help, try removing the mods that have several versions, or are disabled, or don't have the required dependencies.
load-error-needs-new-defines=Yafc encountered an error that can usually be fixed by running a command in Factorio.\nPlease follow these steps:\n\n1) Click '__YAFC__copy-update-defines-command__'.\n2) Start a new game in Factorio.\n3) Press the {`} key. (Usually above Tab and left of 1)\n4) Paste the copied command and press Enter (or Return).\n5) Press {`} again, the up key, and Enter (or Return).\n6) Exit Factorio.\n\nYafc will automatically attempt to reload these mods.
