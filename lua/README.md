# Compiling liblua52.so

Simply run `./build-linux.sh` to (re)build liblua52.so and copy it over to Yafc. The script will compile 
lua with your CFLAGS and LDFLAGS, so feel free to use them if you need debug symbols or security tweaks, for instance.

It will take the following steps
1. Download the source, if not available (from https://www.lua.org/ftp/)
2. Check integrity of the source archive
3. Apply the patches (build-linux.shared object, and Factorio fixes)
4. Build the library
5. Copy into Yafc/lib/linux

## Dependencies
Running the build-linux.sh requires
* `curl` to download the source (if available it is not used)
* `sha256` to check the integrity of the download
* `make` to build Lua
* `gcc` to actually build Lua
