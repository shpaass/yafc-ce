This text is a guideline. You can remove it before posting the issue.
A Feature Design is a proposal that describes the problem and provides one or more solutions to it. Use it if you are a developer and you want to add a feature to Yafc. 
The Feature Design has two main goals:
1. Show the importance of solving the problem. Show the state before and after the problem is resolved, in order to make the improvement obvious. 
2. Describe possible solutions to estimate how much complexity the feature would add. Yafc aims to reduce the complexity of its codebase, so the less complexity the solution adds, the better.
